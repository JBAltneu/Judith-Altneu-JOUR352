        <h2> Experience </h2>

        <h3> Maryland Field Hockey Beat Reporter </h3>
        <h4> WMUC Sports </h4>
        <h5> February 2021- to present </h5>
        <p> I write preview and game recap stories on every Maryland field hockey game and some feature stories on the players. I also participate in media availabilities with the coach and players. One of my recent articles made it into the Shirley Povich Sports Journalism weekly newsletter. </p>

        <h3> Broadcast Reporter </h3>
        <h4> The Left Bench </h4>
        <h5> February 2021- to present </h5>
        <p> I film sport games and then edit the highlights together to make a recap video. I also plan to participate behind the scenes when filming their bimonthly shows. </p>

        <h3> Art Assistant </h3>

        <h5> June-August 2019, 2021 (Was supposed to be the Art Assistant in 2020 but camp was cancelled because of COVID) </h5>
        <p> I helped plan, prepare, lead and assist with art projects for campers ranging in age from kindergarten-5th grade. I also learned how to adapt art projects in limited time to fit different spaces or use less messy materials and delegate tasks to other counselors. </p>
